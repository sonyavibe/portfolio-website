 # portfolio-website
me making my own portfolio website instead of crafting a decent looking cv<br>
> actually it was my first-ever whole project to build using my freshly learned skills in html, css and javascript. i know that it's not perfect (it isn't even filled with content lol) but i'm really proud of my first-born :smirk_cat:

// history of updates<br>
    <b>22-26.08</b> - crafting a responsive ui in figma (project link -> https://www.figma.com/file/Rs0lZCqFW34NASW3KYdAk4/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)<br>
    actually, i've been learning how to code for over a year now but it is my first time trying to build a whole-ass project from scratch all by myself. as they say - the best way to learn is by doing :)<br>
    <b>31.08</b> - made a basic html structure + started crafting css<br>
    <b>01.09</b> - putting up together css - omg it works out!! am i..... able to code?..........ü•∫<br>
    <b>02.09</b> - finished making light theme and set up an actually working email form (i sent myself a pointless message and it worked lol), feeling proud of my own googling abilities :D<br>
    <b>03.09</b> - faced a first struggle but successfully overcame it and added a light/dark mode toggle to the page!<br>
    <b>04.09</b> - designed pop-ups for social media links in figma. also am thinking about adding a navigation area and a "get to the top" buttonüßê<br>
    <b>05.09</b> - designed a brand-new illustration and updated code a little bit<br>
    <b>06-15.09</b> - went on a trip with family to celebrate my birthday. parallel to the adventures was figuring out how flex elements work<br>
    <b>16.09</b> - started making my site adaptive to the dimentions of the browser!<br>
    <b>18.09</b> - had a little mental breakdown and decided to approach responsiveness from another perspective and succeeded! finished putting up mobile version and @media stuff >:)<br>
    <b>19.09</b> - yay i finished with crafting the responsive versions!!<br>
    <b>20.09</b> - today i figured out how to create pop-ups! feeling very accomplished as i wrote a working js and solved a problem, now i just need to fill this modal window with links to my social media (which clearly need some love before exposing them to the publicüòÖ)<br>
    <b>21-24.09</b> - it was hard to pull myself to work after the horrible news... fell into apathy and crisis, couldn't find the answer to why am i even bothering... cobbled myself together and finished with the web-page. now it's time for copywriting, putting together social media and filling the site with content!<br>
    <b>10.10</b> - added links to my socials. ig only projects section left to update and i can actually deploy this!<br>
